# üö® Warning
* You might be manually banned after few weeks, use it at your own risk (wich isn't much as you can create more accounts easily) 
* Using selfbots its against discord [tos](https://discord.com/terms)

#### note
The bot doesn't store which account have already follow you so it might send follow request with accounts that already follow you so the rates will be much lower, i can't do anything but suggest the zoom bot developer to improve the bot.
